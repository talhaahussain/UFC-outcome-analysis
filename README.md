# UFC-outcome-analysis
Continuous Assessment for ECM3420 - Learning From Data, set by Dr. Chico Camargo, Dr. Diogo Pacheco and Dr. Marcos Oliveira (Year 3, Semester 1). Involves the use of machine learning methods, specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to explore which is the best predictor of the outcome of a UFC fight - the fighters' physical metrics or their historical data.

This work received a final mark of 75/100.

Please see `specification.md` for specification. (Unfortunately, original specification does not exist; this is a replica.)
